It has grown from obscurity start of 2008 to become the world's fourth-largest producer. Growth was fueled by debt, now repaid. Expansion from 55 million metric tons in fiscal 2012 to about 190 million metric tons in 2024 means Fortescue supplies around 10% of global seaborne iron ore. Further expansion above 200 million metric tons is likely once its 22 million metric ton Iron Bridge magnetite mine ramps up, likely in 2026 or 2027. However, with longer-term demand likely to decline as China's economy matures, Fortescue's future margins are likely to be below historical averages. More recently, Fortescue diversified into green energy, with ambitions to become a major supplier of green hydrogen and green ammonia. Its efforts are early stage.","iron mining, iron ore, iron ore miner, iron ore mining, iron ore mining service, iron ore producer",,Materials and Resources,Iron and Steel Mining*,http://www.linkedin.com/company/fortescue,171,Elizabeth Gaines,Board Member,egaines@fmgl.com.au,+61 (0)8 6218 8888,,Perth,1983,"Consolidated Minerals, Hunan Hualing Iron & Steel Group Company, Jefferies Financial Group, Jiangsu Fengli Group, Mineral Commodities, The Metals Group, Vale",3899,16235,9445,Publicly Held,Corporation
