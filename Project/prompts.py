INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Analyze companies that are ONLY from the Energy or Maritime sectors as mentioned in the SYSTEM ROLE. For companies that are clearly in other sectors (like Business Products and Services, Manufacturing, Information Technology, etc.), leave ALL information blank and skip analysis.
2. To determine if a company is Energy/Maritime sector, check these criteria in order:
   a) Primary Industry Sector contains: "Energy", "Marine", "Maritime", "Alternative Energy", "Energy Infrastructure", "Energy Storage", "Energy Production", "Oil and Gas"
   b) All Industries contains: "Energy", "Marine", "Maritime", "Alternative Energy", "Energy Infrastructure", "Energy Storage", "Energy Production", "Oil and Gas"
   c) Keywords contain: "maritime", "shipping", "marine", "port", "vessel", "hydrogen", "fuel cell", "energy storage", "renewable energy", "solar", "wind", "battery"
   d) Company Summary mentions: maritime, shipping, marine, port, vessel, hydrogen, fuel cell, energy storage, renewable energy
   
   If NONE of these criteria are met, the company is NOT in the Energy/Maritime sector and should be skipped.
3. If the company is NOT in Energy/Maritime sector, return blank analysis with score 0 and explanation "Not in Energy/Maritime sector".
